INTRODUCTION					*neocomplcache-snippets-complete-introduction*

This source analyzes snippet files for completion. The source offer a function
similar with snipMate.vim and snippetsEmu.vim. Because you can search a snippet
with a function of neocomplcache, you may omit trouble to learn.

==============================================================================
INSTALL						*neocomplcache-snippets-complete-install*

1: Install neocomplcache(https://github.com/Shougo/neocomplcache).
2: Extract the file and put files in your Vim directory
   (usually ~/.vim/ or Program Files/Vim/vimfiles on Windows).

==============================================================================
INTERFACE					*neocomplcache-snippets-complete-interface*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMANDS 					*neocomplcache-snippets-complete-commands*

:NeoComplCacheCachingSnippets [filetype]	*:NeoComplCacheCachingSnippets*
		Caching [filetype] snippet file.
		Select current buffer filetype when [filetype] omitted.

:NeoComplCacheEditSnippets [filetype]		*:NeoComplCacheEditSnippets*
		Edit [filetype] snippets.  Edit current buffer's filetype
		snippets when [filetype] omitted.  When there is not
		[filetype] snippet file, it is generated newly.  This
		command edits a snippet file in g:neocomplcache_snippets_dir
		with precedence.  It is done re-cache automatically when you
		store a snippet file.

:NeoComplCacheEditRuntimeSnippets [filetype]	*:NeoComplCacheEditRuntimeSnippets*
		Edit [filetype] snippets. Edit current buffer's filetype
		snippets when [filetype] omitted. When there is not
		[filetype] snippet file, it is generated newly. This
		command edits a runtime snippet file with snippets_complete.
		It is done re-cache automatically when you store a snippet
		file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VARIABLES 					*neocomplcache-snippets-complete-variables*

g:neocomplcache_snippets_dir			*g:neocomplcache_snippets_dir*
		This variable appoints the pass of the snippet files which
		user defined.  It cuts the directory by plural appointment
		in comma separated value.  When there is not the directory
		which appointed here, neocomplcache will ignore.  User
		defined snippet files are read after having read a normal
		snippet files.  It is overwritten redundant snippet.
		
		There is not this variable unless a user defines it by oneself.

g:neocomplcache_disable_select_mode_mappings	*g:neocomplcache_disable_select_mode_mappings*
		This variable control whether you invalidate Key-mappings of
		Select-mode which snippets_complete performs.  You had
		better usually validate it.
		
		Default value is 1.

g:neocomplcache_snippets_disable_runtime_snippets
						*g:neocomplcache_snippets_disable_runtime_snippets*
		If this variable is 1, runtime snippets isn't loaded.
		This variable is useful to avoid conflicting snippets.

		Default value is 0.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KEY MAPPINGS 					*neocomplcache-snippets-complete-key-mappings*

<Plug>(neocomplcache_snippets_expand)		*<Plug>(neocomplcache_snippets_expand)*
		Expand a cursor snippet of plural lines. When there is not
		snippet, jump to the next placeholder.
		
		Note: cursor snippet must be match keyword patterns.
		For example if snippet name is ".", snippets_complete don't expand it.
		If you expand snippet ".",  Please use
		|<Plug>(neocomplcache_snippets_force_expand)|.

<Plug>(neocomplcache_snippets_jump)		*<Plug>(neocomplcache_snippets_jump)*
		Jump to the next placeholder. If there is no
		placeholder, expand a multiline cursor snippet.

<Plug>(neocomplcache_snippets_force_expand)	*<Plug>(neocomplcache_snippets_force_expand)*
		Expand a cursor snippet. Does nothing if there is not
		snippet.

<Plug>(neocomplcache_snippets_force_jump)	*<Plug>(neocomplcache_snippets_force_jump)*
		Jump to the next place holder. Do not expand any snippet. When
		you do not want to expand a snippet name, use this
		keymapping.

<Plug>(neocomplcache_start_unite_snippet)	*<Plug>(neocomplcache_start_unite_snippet)*
		Start unite snippet source.
		Note: This mappings is available in insert mode.

neocomplcache#sources#snippets_complete#expandable()
						*neocomplcache#sources#snippets_complete#expandable()*
		Use this function on inoremap <expr>. It check whether
		cursor text is snippets trigger or exists placeholder in
		current buffer. This function is useful when saving
		keymappings.
		Return value is
		0 : not found
		1 : cursor text is snippets trigger
		2 : exists placeholder in current buffer
		3 : both found.

						*neocomplcache#sources#snippets_complete#force_expandable()*
		Use this function on inoremap <expr>. It check whether cursor

		keymappings.

neocomplcache#sources#snippets_complete#jumpable()
						*neocomplcache#sources#snippets_complete#jumpable()*
		Use this function on inoremap <expr>. It check whether exists
		placeholder in current buffer. This function is useful when
		saving keymappings.

==============================================================================
SNIPPET SYNTAX					*neocomplcache-snippets-complete-snippet-completion*

neocomplcache has built-in snippet feature. The snippet syntax resembles
|snipMate|.

Example:
>
	snippet     if
	abbr        if endif
	prev_word   '^'
	    if $<1:condition>
	        ${2}
	    endif
<
snippet {snippet_name} syntax is the snippet name.
abbr {abbr_name} is the completion abbrevation (same to completion "abbr" key).
prev_word '^' means this snippet is enabled only in line head.
By the way, it is warned that the snippet name is already defined by same
snippet file.  When you want to overwrite explicitly, as follows:
>
	delete snippets_name
<
And redefine snippet by snippet statement.
When include external files or other snippet file's snippets are overwrited,
will not be warned.

Snippet include feature is available.
>
	include c.snip
<
Eval snippet feature is available.
>
	snippet     hoge
	prev_word   '^'
	    `expand("%")`
<
If you use |:NeoComplCacheEditSnippets| command, edit snippet easily.
When you saved a snippet file, the snippet file is loaded automatically.

Neocomplcache don't mapping expand snippet key automatically. If you use
neocomplcache snippet feature, define below mappings in your .vimrc.
>
	imap <C-l>    <Plug>(neocomplcache_snippets_expand)
	smap <C-l>    <Plug>(neocomplcache_snippets_expand)
<
Placeholder feature is available.
>
	snippet     if
	abbr        if endif
	prev_word   '^'
	    if ${1:condition}
	        ${2}
	    endif
<
'_' snippet feature is supported. '_' snippet is loaded in all filetypes.
And neocomplcache can load snipMate snippets.

Alias feature is supported. Separator is ' ' or ','.
>
	alias hoge hogera hogehoge
<
Synchronized placeholder feature is supported.  $1 is synchronized to ${1}.
When you jump next, it is synchlonized. $0 is last jump placeholder.

The placeholder value can't be contained new line. Below snippet is illegal.
>
	snippet test
		${1:constructor: (${2:args\}) ->
			${3:# do smth}}
<
Multi snippet feature is supported in snipMate.
neocomplcache substitutes trigger and descriptions spaces to '_'.
>
	snippet trigger description1
		hoge
	snippet trigger description2
		piyo
<
You choose snippet <C-n> or <C-p> and expand it with
|<Plug>(neocomplcache_snippets_expand)| key-mappings.

Nested placeholder feature is supported.
But must escape inner '}'. '\' is eacape sequence.
>
	snippet div
	<div ${1:id="${2:someid\}"}>${3}</div>${4}
<
If you indented by hard tab in snippet file, neocomplcache will use shiftwidth
instead of the original indent function provided by Vim. This feature is useful
when you use the language whose indent file can not work very well(example:
PHP).
>
	snippet if
		if (${1:/* condition */}) {
			${2:// code...}
		}
<

UNITE SOURCES					*neocomplcache-snippets-complete-unite-sources*

						*neocomplcache-snippets-complete-unite-source-snippet*
snippet
		The candidates are neocomplcache snippets. The kinds are "snippet".
		Normally, used in |<Plug>(neocomplcache_start_unite_snippet)| mappings.
		But you can execute by ":Unite snippet".
		You can edit snippet file in "edit" action.
		Examples:
>
		imap <C-s>  <Plug>(neocomplcache_start_unite_snippet)
<
source actions

snippet						*neocomplcache-snippets-complete-unite-action-snippet*
	expand		Expand snippet(default action)
	edit		Edit snippet
	preview		View snippet definition
