INTRODUCTION					*neosnippet-introduction*

This plugin analyzes snippet files which you can use for completion. It offers
functionality similar to snipMate.vim or snippetsEmu.vim. Since you can choose
snippets with the neocomplcache interface, you might have less trouble using
them, because you do not have to remember each snippet name.

==============================================================================
INSTALL						*neosnippet-install*

1: Extract the file and put files in your Vim directory
   (usually ~/.vim/ or Program Files/Vim/vimfiles on Windows).

Note: If you want to complete snippets, you must install neocomplcache
(https://github.com/Shougo/neocomplcache).

Note: neocomplcache is NOT required! But recommended.

Extra snippets files are available in:
https://github.com/honza/vim-snippets

==============================================================================
INTERFACE					*neosnippet-interface*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMANDS 					*neosnippet-commands*

:NeoSnippetMakeCache [filetype]
						*:NeoSnippetMakeCache*

		Creates a cache for the given [filetype] snippets. It
		automatically chooses the current buffer's file type unless you
		specify one by [filetype].

					*:NeoComplCacheCachingSnippets*
		Note: |:NeoComplCacheCachingSnippets| is an obsolete name.

:NeoSnippetEdit [{options}] [filetype]
					*:NeoSnippetEdit*
		Opens the [filetype] snippets to edit. It automatically
		selects the current buffer's filetype unless you specify
		another one by [filetype].
		
		If the path to [filetype] snippets is a directory, it
		automatically selects the "[filetype].snip" in the [filetype]
		subdirectory.

		It edits a snippet file in |g:neosnippet#snippets_directory|
		with precedence. The snippets are re-cached automatically
		when you save the file after edit.

					*:NeoComplCacheEditSnippets*
		The following parameters can be used as {options} to modify
		the behavior of the command. Note: You must escape spaces with
		a backslash "\".

					*neosnippet-edit-options-vertical*
		-vertical
		Split the window vertically.

					*neosnippet-edit-options-horizontal*
		-horizontal
		Split the window horizontally.
		
		Note: The behavior is undefined when both options are set.

					*neosnippet-edit-options-direction*
		-direction={direction}
		Define the split position rule. The default value is
		"belowleft".

					*neosnippet-edit-options-split*
		-split
		Split the buffer.

					*neosnippet-edit-options-runtime*
		-runtime
		Edit the runtime (built-in standard) snippets instead of the
		user snippets defined by 'g:neosnippet#snippets_directory'.

		Note: |:NeoComplCacheEditSnippets| is an obsolete name.

:NeoComplCacheEdit -runtime [filetype]

		Opens the [filetype] standard snippets to edit. It
		automatically selects the current buffer's file type snippets
		unless you specify a file type by [filetype]. The snippets are
		re-cached automatically when you save the file after edit.

					*:NeoComplCacheEditRuntimeSnippets*
		Note: |:NeoComplCacheEditRuntimeSnippets| is an obsolete name.

:NeoSnippetSource [filename]
							*:NeoSnippetSource*

		Load [filetype] snippets.
		Note: The loaded snippets are enabled in current buffer only.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VARIABLES 					*neosnippet-variables*

g:neosnippet#snippets_directory		*g:neosnippet#snippets_directory*
		This variable appoints a path to user-defined snippet files.
		You can set multiple values in comma-separated form. Non
		existing directories are ignored.

		User defined snippet files are read after the built-in snippet
		files. If redundant snippets occur they get overwritten and
		only the last one remains.
		
		Note: The neosnippet plug-in loads file type snippets from
		several files if available. For example if you edit a "Vim"
		file then it loads the snippets from:

		- "vim.snip*"
		- "vim_*.snip*" 
	        - "vim/**/*.snip" 

						*g:neocomplcache_snippets_dir*
		Note: |g:neocomplcache_snippets_dir| is an obsolete name.

		This variable doesn't exist unless you declare it.

g:neosnippet#disable_select_mode_mappings
				*g:neosnippet#disable_select_mode_mappings*
		This variable disables key-mappings in |Select-mode| where the
		snippets_complete performs the snippet completion. Usually it
		it better to leave it as it is. But if you have troubles with
		the buffer switcher LustyJuggler you can switch them of.
		
				*g:neocomplcache_disable_select_mode_mappings*
		Note: |g:neocomplcache_disable_select_mode_mappings| is an
		obsolete name.

		The default value is 1.

g:neosnippet#disable_runtime_snippets
				*g:neosnippet#disable_runtime_snippets*
		This is a dictionary variable which uses file types as key.
		If you set the value of a file type entry to 1, this prevents
		loading all the file type specific built-in snippets. This is
		very useful to to prevent snippet conflicts between self
		defined snippet files and the built-in snippet files of
		neosnippet. If you use a "_" as key for an entry this will
		treat the value of the entry as default value for all file
		types.

		Note: This dictionary must be set in your .vimrc.

		For example:
>
		let g:neosnippet#disable_runtime_snippets = {
		\   'c' : 1, 'cpp' : 1,
		\ }
		
		" Works like g:neocomplcache_snippets_disable_runtime_snippets
		" which disables all runtime snippets
		let g:neosnippet#disable_runtime_snippets = {
		\   '_' : 1,
		\ }
<
			*g:neocomplcache_snippets_disable_runtime_snippets*
		Note: |g:neocomplcache_snippets_disable_runtime_snippets| is
		an obsolete name.

		The default value is {}.

g:neosnippet#enable_snipmate_compatibility
				*g:neosnippet#enable_snipmate_compatibility*
		If it is non 0, neosnippet will enable snipMate compatibility
		feature(For example: Filename() function).

		The default value is 0.

g:neosnippet#enable_preview			 *g:neosnippet#enable_preview*
		If it is non 0, neosnippet will enable preview window
		feature.

		The default value is 0.

==============================================================================
SNIPPET SYNTAX					*neosnippet-snippet-syntax*

It is quite easy to create your own snippets starting with the example below.
The snippet syntax is close to the one of |snipMate|. 

Example:

>
	snippet    [name]
	abbr       [abbreviation]
	alias      [aliases]
	regexp     [pattern]
	options    [options]
	   if ${1:condition}
	     ${2}
	   endif
<

Snippet Keywords:

- snippet [name] (Required)

   Each snippet starts with the keyword "snippet". This keyword is directly
   followed by the snippet name. The snippet name is used for the expansion of
   the snippet.

- abbr [name] (Optional)

   Here you can define an abbreviation of the snippet which will be used in
   the drop down menu of neocomplcache.

- alias [aliases] (Optional)

   If you specify an alias it will be also used to expand a snippet. You can
   define multiple aliases either using the separators ' ' or ','.

   Example

>
   alias hoge hogera hogehoge
<

- regexp [pattern] (Optional)

   This snippet expands when it matched by the regexp pattern only.

   Example

>
   regexp '^% '
<

- options [options] (Optional)

   Options influence the snippet behavior. The possible options are:

   + word	This snippet expands by a word boundary. Note: To complete
		the trigger in snippets_complete, it must be word(digits or
		alphabet characters or "_") characters.

>
	snippet     date
	options     word
	    `strftime("%d %b %Y")`
<

   + head	This snippet expands on the beginning of a line only.
		Note: This is the same as "prev_word '^'" which is still
		there for backwards compatibility.

>
	snippet     if
	options     head
	  if ${1:condition}
	     ${2}
	  endif
<

   + indent	Neosnippet indents the snippet after expansion to the same
		column as the line above.

Below the keywords starts the snippet which gets expanded. After the snippet
expansion you can jump to the placeholders and replace them with desired text.

The structure of a placeholder can be:

- ${number:placeholder text}

   Here the number of the placeholder and the placeholder text that are
   separated by a ":" are embraced by a pair of "{}". The text is displayed
   after the snippet expansion and gets replaced by your text. If you jump
   over the snippet and do not insert any text in that position the
   placeholder text remains there. This can be used as a standard value for a
   certain position.

   Example

>
	snippet     if
	   if ${1:condition}
	     ${2}
	   endif
<

- ${number:#:placeholder text}

   Here the number is followed by the "#" character. If you jump over this
   placeholder and do not insert any text, the placeholder text will be
   removed.

   Example

>
	snippet if
	   if ${1:#:condition}
	     ${2}
	   endif
<

- ${number:TARGET}

   This is the target placeholder which will be replaced by the text which is
   selected before snippet expansion.
   Note: You need to expand you snippet with the key mapping below for this to
   work.

   |<Plug>(neosnippet_expand_target)|.

   This is very useful if you edit text and decide to put something in an
   environment or some sort of brackets.

   Example

>
	snippet if
	   if ${1:#:condition}
	     ${2:TARGET}
	   endif
<

- ${number}

   This is a placeholder which you can use as a simple jump position. This
   can be useful if you edit a placeholder inside of some sort of brackets or
   environment and after that want to go on behind that.

   Example

>
	snippet     if
	   if ${1:#:condition}
	     ${2:do}
	   endif
	
	   ${3}
<

- $number

   This is a synchronized placeholder. Sometimes it is required to repeat a
   value in several places inside a snippet. If you set the number of this
   placeholder to the same number as one of the other placeholders in the
   snippet it will repeat its content. $1 is synchronized to ${1} and so on.
   $0 will be the final jump placeholder.

   Example

>
	snippet namespace
	   namespace ${1:name} {
		${0}
	   } // namespace $1
<

Note: If you like to include characters in snippets that already have a
special meaning to neosnippet you need to escape them with a backslash.

>
	snippet code
	   \`${1}\`${2}

	snippet test
	   ${1:escape \} value}

	# Substitute "\$0" to "$0"
	snippet     main
	options     head
	    if __FILE__ == \$0
	        ${1:TARGET}
	    end
<

A placeholder value can not contain new lines. The snippet below isn't valid.

>
	snippet invalid
	   ${1:constructor: (${2:args\}) ->
	     ${3:# do smth}}
<

Vim has a built-in expression evaluation. You can also use this feature inside
of snippets if you use back ticks like in the example below where "%:t" gets
expanded to name of the current active file when the snippet gets expanded and
the current time gets inserted by the expansion of the strftime command.

>
	snippet     header
	   File: ${1:`expand('%:t')`}
	   ${2:Created at: `strftime("%B %d, %Y")`}
<

You can also nest the placeholders if you escape the special characters.

>
	snippet div
	   <div ${1:id="${2:someid\}"}>${3}</div>${4}
<

In some cases you need to escape the "}" twice as the example below shows.

>
	snippet  catch
	options  head
	    catch ${1:/${2:pattern: empty, E484, Vim(cmdname):{errmsg\\}\}/}
<

This is because ${1:} substitutes the pattern to "/${2:pattern: empty, E484,
Vim(cmdname):{errmsg\}}" and ${2:} substitutes the pattern to "pattern: empty,
E484, Vim(cmdname):{errmsg}"

If you create a snippet file and prepend the filename with a "_" neosnippet
treats the snippets inside the file as global. This means that they will be
available for all file types (e.g _.snip). You can include other snippet files
from within a snippet file with.

>
	include c.snip
<

Or if you want to include a whole directory with file type snippets.

>
	include javascript/*
<

If you include snippet files it can happen that the same snippet name is used
multiple times in different snippet files. Neosnippet produces a warning if it
detects this. If you want to overwrite a snippet explicitly, please use:

>
	delete snippets_name
<

After that you can redefine the snippet. But this does not work if you include
external snippet files. There will be no warning when snippets get overwritten.

Multi snippet feature in snipMate is available.
Neosnippet substitutes trigger and descriptions spaces to '_'.
>
	snippet trigger description1
	    hoge
	snippet trigger description2
	    piyo
<

If you use hard-tab for indentation in snippet file, neosnippet will use
'shiftwidth' instead of Vim indent plugin. This feature is useful while some
languages' indent files can not work very well (e.g.: PHP, Python).
>
	snippet if
	  if (${1:/* condition */}) {
	      ${2:// code...}
	  }
<

Note: "#{string}" is comment string. But it must be in head.
>
	# It is comment string
	  # It is not comment string!
<

Note: Neosnippet ignores empty or spaces lines in snippet end. If you want to insert empty
line in snippet end, you must insert placeholder.
>
	# This is valid.
	snippet     #!
	abbr        #!/usr/bin/env ruby
	alias       shebang
	options     head
	  #!/usr/bin/env ruby
	  
	  ${0}

	# This is invalid(ignores spaces lines!).
	snippet     #!
	abbr        #!/usr/bin/env ruby
	alias       shebang
	options     head
	  #!/usr/bin/env ruby
	  
	  
<
Note: If you expand oneline snippet, the markers will be deleted in
|InsertLeave|.

==============================================================================
UNITE SOURCES					*neosnippet-unite-sources*

					*neosnippet-unite-source-snippet*
snippet
		The candidates of the snippet source are neosnippet snippets.
		and their kind is "snippet". You can use the snippet source
		with the mapping |<Plug>(neosnippet_start_unite_snippet)|.
		But you can also execute it by ":Unite snippet". The snippet
		source offers an edit action you can use to edit the snippet
		files.
		
		Example:
>
		imap <C-s>  <Plug>(neosnippet_start_unite_snippet)
<
				*neosnippet-unite-source-neosnippet/user*
neosnippet/user
		The candidates of the user snippet files.

				*neosnippet-unite-source-neosnippet/runtime*
neosnippet/runtime
		The candidates of the runtime snippet files.

source actions

snippet					*neosnippet-unite-action-snippet*
	expand		Expand snippet (default action)
	edit		Edit snippet
	preview		View snippet definition

==============================================================================
FAQ						*neosnippet-faq*

Q: What if I want to expand a snippet trigger after (, [, " etc...:

A: You should use "options word" in the snippet definition. This changes the
expansion behavior to a word boundary.
>
	snippet     date
	options     word
	    `strftime("%d %b %Y")`
<

Q: Why does neosnippet not indent the expanded snippet?

A: You should use "options indent" in the snippet definition. In default,
neosnippet doesn't indent the expanded line.

Q: What if Neosnippet conflicts with |LustyJuggler|.
http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2050

A: Please try below settings:
Note: But you must unmap the mappings in select mode manually.
>
	let g:neosnippet#disable_select_mode_mappings = 0
<

Q: Error using snipmate-snippets
Note: snipmate-snippets is currently vim-snippets.
https://github.com/Shougo/neosnippet/issues/86

A: Please try below settings. It defines snipMate function.
>
	let g:neosnippet#enable_snipmate_compatibility = 1
<
Q: Cannot jump over placeholder
https://github.com/Shougo/neosnippet/issues/120

A: You must use smap in .vimrc.
>
	imap <expr><TAB> neosnippet#expandable_or_jumpable() ?
	\ "\<Plug>(neosnippet_expand_or_jump)" : "\<TAB>"
	smap <expr><TAB> neosnippet#expandable_or_jumpable() ?
	\ "\<Plug>(neosnippet_expand_or_jump)" : "\<TAB>"
<
Because neosnippet uses select-mode to jump over placeholder.

Q: I want to disable preview window in neosnippet candidates.

A:
>
	set completeopt-=preview
